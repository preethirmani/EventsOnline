    about:`Enter the world of 1920s Paris to drink and dance the night away to welcome 2023 in style.

The Winemakers Reserve (Woodinville) will be transformed into the world-famous Moulin Rouge Cabaret & Lounge for the evening. Throughout the night, guests will revel in lively entertainment, dancing, a decadent Parisian Patisserie, Parisian-themed specialty cocktails, Absinthe drip fountain cocktails, party hats/noisemakers & a midnight countdown.

The Seattle Solid Gold Band will be performing Big Band favorites, Sinatra-style crooner songs and Swing classics in the main Tasting Room ~ which will be the main stage of the "Moulin Rouge". Dance the night away, or enjoy the view from your RESERVED seating (for two only -- limited reserved seating available) closest to the stage/dance floor. There will be additional seating throughout the venue, that will not be reserved. This room is where all the action is and will be more lively and loud.

The Cellar Room is a smaller room off the main tasting room and will feature white linen'd table tops, twinkling lights and candles - as well as four plush seating areas. This is where the charming Lu Lu Swing Band (an all-female band of five) will enchant guests with classic Parisian and French songs. The vibe in this room is more chill....romantic...Parisian Bistro/Lounge.
